# First phase
turning and turning in the widening gyre

the falcon cannot hear the falconer

things fall apart; the center cannot hold


# Second phase

Surely some revelation is at hand;

Surely the Second Coming is at hand.

The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out

When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi

Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert

A shape with lion body and the head of a man,

A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
